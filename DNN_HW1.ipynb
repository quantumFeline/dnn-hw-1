        "In this project, you will design, implement, and evaluate a **multitask neural network** that performs **two tasks simultaneously**:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Classification** – identify which pair of geometric shape types appears in a 28×28 binary image (135 possible configurations).\n",
        "2. **Regression** – predict how many shapes of each type are present (6 regression targets).\n",
        "\n",
        "This project focuses on **multi-task learning**, i.e., using one shared model to learn several related tasks at once. You will compare how adding an auxiliary task affects performance and training dynamics.\n",
